v0.0.3

1. Fixed the scrolling issue.
2. Added a body container to fix the duplicate code.
3. Added ids for proper page linking.

Known Bugs:
-Text in .tea-container seems far away from the picture compared to the mockup.
-A lot of my spacing in the bottom half of the page doesn't line up with the mockup.
-HTML anchor not offsetting to account for the fixed header.
